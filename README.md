This repository will be used to display any coding that I will do for CS 401. This README will be updated accordingly as things are added or I have other things to say!

<b>final_program.ino</b>

This is the final implimentation of the code used to keep track of the time and how the ESP8266 gets the current weather from the internet. This code is based on Dougs code from <a href="http://www.dougswordclocks.com/">Dougs word clock</a> 


These files where how I started building up the code needed for the project
